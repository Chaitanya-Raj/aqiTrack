            <h1 class="page-title">Air Quality Index</h1>
            <p>
              An air quality index (AQI) is used by government agencies to
              communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how
              polluted it is forecast to become. Public health risks increase as
              the AQI rises. Different countries have their own air quality
              indices, corresponding to different national air quality
              standards.<br /><br />
              We at aqiTrack use the US Air Quality Index.
