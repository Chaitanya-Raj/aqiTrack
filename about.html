            <p>
              We at aqiTrack seek to provide you with real-time AQI indicators
              of the location of your choice. The efficient and precise
              personalized feed ensures that you're always prepared for the day,
              no matter the pollution level.

          <h1 class="page-title">Air Pollution</h1>
          <p>
            Air pollution occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of
            substances are introduced into Earth's atmosphere. Sources of air
            pollution include gases (such as ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur
            dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons),
            particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules.
            <br /><br />
            It may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may
            also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food
            crops, and may damage the natural or built environment. Both human
            activity and natural processes can generate air pollution. Air
            pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of
            pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart
            disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer.<br /><br />
            The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but
            principally affect the body's respiratory system and the
            cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend
            on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of
            exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics. Indoor
            air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the
            world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith
            Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report. Outdoor air
            pollution alone causes 2.1 to 4.21 million deaths annually. Overall,
            air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide
            each year, and is the world's largest single environmental health
            risk.

            <h1 class="page-title">Air Quality Index</h1>
            <p>
              An air quality index (AQI) is used by government agencies to
              communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how
              polluted it is forecast to become. Public health risks increase as
              the AQI rises. Different countries have their own air quality
              indices, corresponding to different national air quality
              standards.<br /><br />
              We at aqiTrack use the US Air Quality Index.
